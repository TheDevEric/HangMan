# HangMan
A simple Hangman game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words, and the player needs to guess the letters of the word one by one. For each incorrect guess, the game draws a part of a hangman's body until the entire hangman is drawn. The player wins if they successfully guess all the letters of the word before the hangman is completed.

This self assigned project allowed me to further understand programming concepts.
